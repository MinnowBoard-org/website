##Getting Started
Congratulations on purchasing your new MinnowBoard Turbot! This is the landing page for developers who are taking their boards out of the box. We provide guidance on getting started, navigating the website content, and how to get help along the way. The MinnowBoard.org goal is for developers to prototype AND productize! Let's get started... 

###Components
- **MinnowBoard Turbot**

###Get a board
Visit [Get a board](get-a-board) to find the right board and accessories to support your project.


- **Buy a Board**: If you are on this page, you most likely have your board; if not, visit the [Get a board](get-a-board) page to find a list of available boards and where to buy them.
- **Buy Accessories**: Once you have your board, take some time to check out the optional and required accessories.
