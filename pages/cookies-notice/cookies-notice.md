## MinnowBoard Cookies and Similar Technologies Notice

Our Sites (as defined below) use Cookies and Similar Technologies to ensure that
we give our visitors the best possible experience by providing you personalized
information, remembering your marketing and product preferences, and helping you
obtain the right information. You can find out more about Cookies and Similar
Technologies, how we use them, and how to control them below.

### Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies

This Notice describes how MinnowBoard.org, our partners, and our other third
parties use Cookies and Similar Technologies (such as pixel tags, web beacons,
clear GIFs, JavaScript, and local storage). We will refer to these Cookies and
Similar Technologies simply as “Cookies” for the rest of Notice. We will also
describe what options you may have regarding those Cookies. This Notice covers
MinnowBoard.org’s use of Cookies that may be used in connection with the web sites
(including mobile web sites and apps) owned and controlled by MinnowBoard.org
(the “Sites”).

In some cases, we may use Cookies to collect information that is personally
identifiable, or that can become personally identifiable if we combine it with
other information. In such cases, the [MinnowBoard.org Privacy Notice](privacy-policy) will apply
in addition to this MinnowBoard.org Notice.

### What are Cookies and Similar Technologies?

Cookies are small files—usually consisting of letters and numbers—placed on your
computer, tablet, phone, or similar device, when you use that device to visit a
web site. Cookies are widely used by web site owners to make their web sites
operate, work more efficiently, and provide analytic information.

These are the different types of Cookies we and our service providers may use on
our Sites:

-	**Essential Cookies.** These Cookies are required for the operation of our
    Sites (for example, to enable you to log into secure areas of our web site
    or use a shopping cart). These Cookies enable you to move around the Sites
    and use their features. Disabling these Cookies will encumber the Sites’
    performance and may make the features and service unavailable.
-	**Analytics and Customization Cookies.** These Cookies allow us to analyze
    activities on our Sites and on other sites where we post content in order to
    improve and optimize the way our Sites work. For example, we may use these
    types of Cookies to ensure that visitors can easily find the information
    they are looking for on our web sites. One way we do this is to recognize
    and count the number of visitors and see how they move around our web site
    when they are using it. Analytics cookies also help us measure the performance
    of our advertising campaigns in order to help us improve our advertising
    campaigns and to optimize our Sites’ content for those who engage with our
    advertising.
-	**Functionality Cookies.** These Cookies are used to recognize you when you
    return to our Sites. This enables us to personalize our content for you, greet
    you by name, and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language
    or region).
-	**Advertising Cookies.** These Cookies record your online activities, including
    your visits to our Sites, the pages you have visited, and the links and
    advertisements you have clicked. One purpose of this is to help make the content
    displayed on our Sites more relevant to you. Another purpose is to allow us
    and our service providers to deliver advertisements or other communications
    to you that are designed to be more relevant to your apparent interests. When
    we and our service providers do so, this also involves partners such as
    publishers, data management platforms, and demand side platforms that help to
    manage the data. For example, if you look at one page on one of our Sites,
    we may cause an advertisement to be delivered to you, on our Sites or on other
    sites, for products referenced on that page or for similar products and services.
    We and our service providers and partners may also append other data to
    information collected by these Cookies, including information obtained from
    third parties, and share this information with third parties for the purpose
    of delivering ads to you.

### How does MinnowBoard.org Collect and Use Other Information?

We and our service providers may use Cookies for a variety of purposes, including to:

-	Help us and third parties obtain information about your visits to the Sites;
-	Process your orders;
-	Analyze your visiting patterns to improve our Sites;
-	Deliver advertising, communications, and content from us and third parties,
    on our Sites and those of third parties, specific to your interests;
-	Remember your language and other preferences;
-	Help you obtain information you are looking for;
-	Provide a safe and secure service for online transactions;
-	Measure how many people use our Sites, and how they use them, to keep our
    Sites running efficiently and to better understand our Sites’ audiences.
-	If you register on one of our Sites, or otherwise provide us with your personal
    information, we may associate that information with other information we
    collect from or about you or that you provide, information regarding your use
    of our Sites, or information we receive from or about you from third parties.
    We will use this combined data for marketing and analytics purposes.

### How Long do Cookies Stay on My Device?

Other Cookies operate from the time you visit a MinnowBoard.org service to the
end of that particular web browsing session. These Cookies expire and are
automatically deleted when you close your Internet browser. These Cookies are
called “session” Cookies.

Some Cookies will stay on your device between browsing sessions—they do not
expire when you close your browser. These Cookies are called “persistent” Cookies.
The length of time a persistent Cookie stays on your device varies from Cookie
to Cookie. We and others use persistent Cookies for a variety of purposes, such
as to store your preferences so that they are available for the next visit, and
to keep a more accurate account of how often you visit our Sites, how often you
return, how your use of the Sites may vary over time, and the effectiveness of
advertising efforts.

### Who Puts the Cookies on My Device?

Cookies may be placed on your device by MinnowBoard.org as the Site operator.
These Cookies are called “first party” Cookies. Some Cookies may be placed on
your device by a party other than MinnowBoard.org. These Cookies are called
“third party” Cookies. For example, a MinnowBoard.org partner may place a third
party Cookie to enable online chat services.

Cookies may also be used that allow us and third parties to know when you visit
our Sites, and to understand how you interact with e-mails, advertisements, or
other content. Through Cookies, aggregate and other information not identifying
individual users (such as your operating system, browser version, and the URL
you came from, including from e-mails and advertisements) may be obtained and
used to enhance your experience and understand traffic patterns. This technology
counts the number of users who visit a particular service from specific banner
advertisements outside the MinnowBoard.org Site or who clicked on links or graphics
included in e-mail newsletters received from MinnowBoard.org. It is also used as
a tool to compile aggregated statistics about how MinnowBoard.org Sites are used,
to perform analytics and help us to optimize our Sites, and to help serve you
advertising based on your interests, as described in further detail below.

### How does MinnowBoard.org Use Online and Mobile Advertising?

We and third parties, including technology partners, and service providers engage
in interest-based advertising to deliver advertisements and personalized content
that we and other advertisers believe will be of interest to you. To the extent
third party vendors are using Cookies to perform these services for MinnowBoard.org
or others, MinnowBoard.org does not control the use of this technology or the
resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such
third parties.

Ads may be delivered to you based on your online or mobile behavior (on
MinnowBoard.org Sites and non-MinnowBoard.org sites), your search activity, your
responses to one of our advertisements or e-mails, the pages you visit, your
general geographic location, or other information. These ads may appear on our
Sites or on third party web sites. The technology partners with whom we work to
help us conduct interest-based advertising may be members of self-regulatory
associations such as the [Network Advertising Initiative (NAI)](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) and the [Digital
Advertising Alliance (DAA)](http://www.aboutads.info/). For Sites directed at persons located in the European
Union, we may work with technology partners who are members of the [European Digital
Advertising Alliance (eDAA)](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/). You may also see advertisements for third parties
on MinnowBoard.org Sites or other web sites or properties, based on your visits
to, and activities on, MinnowBoard.org Sites and other sites.
