| Standoffs | [McMaster-Carr](https://www.mcmaster.com/#female-threaded-round-standoffs/=16lgm1q) | Female threaded aluminum Standoffs at McMaster-Carr. Aluminum is ideal for sturdy feet to keep your board off the desk surface, helping to prevent shorts and other damage, and also for securing expansion cards (Lures) to the baseboard. **Recommended** : Thread = 6-32, Material = Aluminum, Outside Diamater (OD) = 1/4", Shape = Round. Then select desired length: **Desktop Feet**: Most people prefer around [5/8" Length](https://www.mcmaster.com/#93330A446) standoff for desktop feet (4 per board), though some prefer a taller [1" Length](https://www.mcmaster.com/#93330A449).  Desktop standoffs are often paired with rubber feet. As you can see by inspecting the height of bottom side components, other standoffs may work. **For mounting expansion cards (Lures) to baseboard** : use [5/8" Length](https://www.mcmaster.com/#93330A446) for Low-Speed-Expansion LSEV1; use [5/16” Length](https://www.mcmaster.com/#93330a442) for High-Speed-Expansion HSEv1; (4 per board). **Female threaded standoffs** also available at [Mouser](http://www.mouser.com/Electromechanical/Hardware/Standoffs-Spacers/_/N-aictf/) at lengths: [5/8"](http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/RAF-Electronic-Hardware/1686-632-AL/?qs=sGAEpiMZZMtrde5aJd3qw0AN1sweODAOXwba0jzYDXA%3d), [5/16”](http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/RAF-Electronic-Hardware/2101-632-AL-7/?qs=sGAEpiMZZMtrde5aJd3qw8BUoqM2q3%252bQ0FNZWGpFdIA%3d), [1"](http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/RAF-Electronic-Hardware/1692-632-AL/?qs=sGAEpiMZZMtrde5aJd3qw4906qPZKIlyLaZZgp%2ffwe4%3d). |
| Rubber Feet | [McMaster-Carr](https://www.mcmaster.com/#9540k693/=16a7i3d) | We like to attach to the bottom of standoffs that will sit on the desktop surface, to prevent sliding around. Entirely optional, but it gives a good feel. Many options available. Look for a "counterbore" of 1/4" to match the standoffs and screws. |
| Standoff/Nut Kits| [Amazon Nylon Kit v1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EPLH08Y/ref=psdc_16409981_t3_B01I0SORIE?th=1) [Amazon Nylon Kit v2](https://www.amazon.com/180Pcs-M3-Hex-Spacers-Screw-Nut-Standoffs-Quadcopter-Drone-Raspberry/dp/B01I0SORIE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1486673441&sr=8-1&keywords=board+standoffs) | These are a cheap way to get the standard lengths in Nylon material. |
