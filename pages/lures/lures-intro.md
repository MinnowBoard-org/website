#### Expansion Boards (Lures) Overview

For truly fast prototyping, explore expanding 
the base capability of your MinnowBoard Turbot by 
connecting breakout boards to either the Low Speed 
Expansion header (LSE - top side 26 pin connector) or 
High Speed Expansion header (HSE - a 60 pin high 
density connector on the reverse side of the board). 

To do this, you’ll need to purchase or design breakout
boards (Lures).
