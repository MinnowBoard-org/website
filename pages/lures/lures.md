## Expansion Boards (Lures) Overview

Breakout boards called "Lures" expand functionality of MinnowBoard development boards 
by connecting to either the low- or high-speed expansion connectors. 

**Note:** Lures are owned and supported by their respective owners and manufacturers. 
If you have issues the community can only give you best effort support, but 
issues should be taken to the respective manufacturers and designers.

need to have enough information to fully build the lure on their own.
