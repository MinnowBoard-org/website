## Silverjaw Lure

The Silverjaw Lure is dual break-out board providing both an mPCIe and mSATA slot via the MinnowBoard MAX HSE connector.
This lure is produced and sold by Tin Can Tools (Note: Lures are owned and supported by their respective owners and manufactures. The community can only give you best effort support; issues should be taken to the respective manufacturers and designers.)
The Silverjaw Lure is an expansion board for the MinnowBoard Max that plugs into the High Speed Expansion (HSE) connector on the bottom of the MinnowBoard Max. It adds dual interfaces: mSATA socket and mPCIE socket. The Silverjaw Lure provides switching power supplies (+3VDC & +1.5VDC) so it is very efficent and minimizes the current draw from the MinnowBoard Max's main +5V power supply.

mSATA
The mSATA socket interfaces to the MinnowBoard Max's PCI express bus which provides a high bandwidth interface for memory cards. The MinnowBoard Max can be configured to boot from the mSATA memory card. The mSATA socket supports both half-size and full-sized mSATA memory cards.
mPCIe
The mPCIe socket interfaces to the MinnowBoard Max's PCI express bus which provides a high bandwidth interface for mPCIe cards. The mPCIe socket accepts the following type of mPCIe cards: wifi, SATA drive interfaces, SD memory card, USB 2.0, USB 3.0, RS-232 serial cards, etc.
Note: Tin Can Tools recommends using a +5VDC@3A power supply when using the Silverjaw Lure with the MinnowBoard Max.
