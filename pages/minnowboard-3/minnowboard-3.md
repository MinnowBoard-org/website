# Meet MinnowBoard 3

![MinnowBoard 3 - Top](pages/minnowboard-3/board-coming-soon.png)

The MinnowBoard 3 is a powerful, expandable developer board with integrated
wifi and bluetooth. This fully open source board with committed firmware 
and an easily modified 6-layer design gets you from prototype to production 
quickly. Its enormous range of capabilities appeal to innovators, professional 
developers, and OEMs interested in prototyping and bringing to market 
high-performance IoT and embedded applications and products.

This first board of the MinnowBoard 3 series opens up the power and features 
of the Intel(r) Atom x5-E3940, four cores at 1.6/1.8Ghz, with 4GB LPDDR4 in a 
form factor and price targeted for broad market verticals, yet allows easy design 
modification to meet specific product applications. EMI/EMC is targeted for FCC 
Class B compliance, so you can easily achieve regulatory thresholds for your 
product. See the below product detail for more information.

Initial product launch is targeted for North America and Europe at Amazon, 
Mouser, and Netgate. Reach out to us with feedback, comments, and/or distributor 
recommendations on our [Get help page](https://minnowboard.org/help) or
